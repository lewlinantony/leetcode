## Features

- üìÖ **Submission Calendar**: Visual representation of your daily LeetCode submissions over the past year
- üî• **Current Streak**: Shows your current consecutive submission streak to keep you motivated
- üé® **Clean Design**: Familiar contribution graph aesthetics with color-coded activity levels
- ‚ö° **Auto-refresh**: Updates every hour to keep your stats current
- üåô **Dark Theme**: Matches macOS dark mode perfectly
- üí™ **Daily Motivation**: Having your progress visible on your desktop encourages consistent practice

## Installation

1. Install [√úbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) if you haven't already
2. Download the `leetcode.jsx` file from this repository
3. Move the `leetcode.jsx` file to your √úbersicht widgets folder (usually `~/Library/Application Support/√úbersicht/widgets/`)
4. Configure your LeetCode username (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

Open `leetcode.jsx` and modify the following settings at the top of the file:

```javascript
// --- USER SETTINGS ---
const leetcodeUsername = "your-username-here"; // Replace with your actual LeetCode username

// Widget dimensions and position
const widgetWidth = 317;
const widgetHeight = 125;
const widgetLeft = 15;
const widgetTop = 335; // Adjust position on your desktop
```

### Positioning

- `widgetLeft`: Distance from the left edge of your screen (in pixels)
- `widgetTop`: Distance from the top edge of your screen (in pixels)
- `widgetWidth` & `widgetHeight`: Widget dimensions (modify if needed)

## API Information

This widget uses the [LeetCode Stats API](https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com) to fetch your submission data. The API has rate limits, so the widget refreshes every hour to avoid hitting these limits.

### Rate Limits

- The widget refreshes every hour (3,600,000 milliseconds)
- If you encounter rate limit errors, the widget will display an error message and retry on the next refresh cycle

## Color Coding

The calendar uses a clean color-coding system:
- **Dark Gray** (`#1a1a1a`): No submissions
- **Dark Green** (`#0e4429`): 1 submission
- **Medium Green** (`#006d32`): 2 submissions  
- **Bright Green** (`#26a641`): 3+ submissions
- **Brightest Green** (`#39d353`): High activity

## Troubleshooting

### Widget not showing data
1. Verify your LeetCode username is correct and publicly accessible
2. Check the browser console in √úbersicht for error messages
3. Ensure your LeetCode profile is public (the API cannot access private profiles)

### Rate limit errors
- Wait a few hours for the rate limit to reset
- The widget will automatically retry on the next refresh cycle

### Positioning issues
- Adjust `widgetLeft` and `widgetTop` values in the configuration section
- Restart √úbersicht after making changes

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Modify the `getColor()` function to use different colors:

```javascript
const getColor = (count) => {
  if (count === 0) return "#your-color";
  // ... customize other levels
};
```

### Adjusting Refresh Rate
Change the `refreshFrequency` value (in milliseconds):

```javascript
export const refreshFrequency = 3600000; // 1 hour = 3,600,000ms
```

**Note**: Don't set this too low to avoid hitting API rate limits.
